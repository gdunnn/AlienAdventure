# AlienAdventure
This text-based adventure game is my first EVER project using Python!
I had so much fun learning to create this little game!
This was for my introduction to scripting class,and it taught me
many fundementals that will prove to be valuable as I continue
on my programming journey. I am excited to learn more and I can't
wait to see what project I am going to create next!
